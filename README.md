# Near Field Circuit

## Project Overview
**Near Field Circuit** is an innovative fusion of art and technology, creating a unique collection of NFC-enabled coins crafted from precious metals. This project integrates cutting-edge NFC technology with the timeless value of metals like gold and silver, offering a seamless interaction between physical collectibles and digital assets.

## Features

- **Material Excellence**: Coins are crafted from high-quality materials including gold, silver, and bronze, each serving as an active NFC antenna.
- **ARX Chip Technology**: Each coin incorporates ARX technology with an Ethereum library adapted for use with the LUKSO blockchain.
